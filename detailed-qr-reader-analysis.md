## Detailed QR Reader Analysis

### Background
Modern QR code readers are being implemented widely in various sectors. These analyses provide detailed insights into performance metrics.

### Performance Metrics
The metrics evaluated for each QR code reader include:
1. Scan Accuracy
2. Processing Time
3. Error Recovery Efficiency

### Tools and Methodology
All tools used are open-source and replicable:
- ISO 18004 Standards compliance tests.
- Benchmark tests against varying light, angle, and distance.
- Data integrity checks with redundant codes.

### Observations
Below are detailed observations across various scenarios:
- Scenario A: Perfect Lighting - High scan accuracy with negligible delays.
- Scenario B: Low Lighting - Handheld reader efficiency drops to 70%. Others maintain standard performance.
- Scenario C: Angular Scans - Distorted barcodes take 20% longer to scan.

### Conclusion
Understanding these metrics and contexts of QR code reader applications can provide valuable insights into their practical applications and constraints.
